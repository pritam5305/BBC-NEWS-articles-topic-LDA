Problem Scenario: You are given a zip file which contains summaries of news from BBC. The
data is taken from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/pariza/bbc-news-summary).
The zip file contains a folder: BBC News Articles
This folder contains 5 sub-folders, named:
1. Business
2. Entertainment
3. Politics
4. Sports
5. Tech
Each of these sub-folders contains text files which have summaries of different news articles.
Objective: To perform document clustering in order to assign similar articles under a single
cluster label.
Tasks to Perform:
● Read all the files from all the sub-folders and store their summaries in a single CSV file.
Name the .csv file as: BBCNewsArticles.csv
The .csv file should contain:

Article
&lt;The text from file 1
&gt;
&lt;The text from file 2&gt;
&lt;The text from file 3&gt;
………

● Randomly arrange the data to avoid data-biased modeling.
● Preprocess each article using text preprocessing (Hint: Use the preprocess module
preloaded in the lab for the same. The preprocess module refines the string using
tokenization function, WordNet lemmatizer function, and stop word removal function.
● On the preprocessed text, perform vectorization using three types of vectors:

1. PresenceAbsenceVector: It converts articles to vectors using Presence
and Absence of Words. If the token exists, it results in index 1 and if it
doesn’t, it displays the vector index as 0.
2. CountVector: Converts articles to vectors using count of words.
3. TF-IDF Vector: Converts articles to vectors using TF-IDF vectorization.
● Perform clustering on the dataset using all 3 types of vectorizations. The number of
clusters should be five.
You can choose any appropriate clustering algorithm.
Make models for each type of vectorization. We will have a total of three models.

● Save the cluster’s label for each model in a new CSV file named:
BBCNewsArticlesClustered.csv
● Evaluate and compare the performance of the 3 models based on Silhouette Coefficient.
● Provide visualizations for all the 3 models. You can show scatter plots and bar graphs
comparing the distribution of articles within the clusters.
● Provide your explanation for the following questions:
1. What does the Silhouette Coefficient tell us?
2. Which algorithm did you choose and why?
3. Can you provide an appropriate name to a cluster label? If yes, explain your
observations.
4. Which vectorization technique is the best and why?
